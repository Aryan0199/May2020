i think u shud try vector rather than array.
vector is almost same as array ,its just uses dynamic allocation rather than static as it happens in array.


example:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    vector<int> v;
    for(int i=0;i<100001;i++)
       {
          
          v.push_back(i);
       }
    cout<<v[100000];
}
